# Project Architecture Guidelines

## File Organization

### Directory Structure
- Keep related files together in logical directories
- Use descriptive directory names that reflect their purpose
- Separate concerns (presentation, data, utilities)
- Group by feature when appropriate

### File Naming
- Use kebab-case for file and directory names
- Use descriptive names that indicate purpose
- Include file type in name when helpful (e.g., `theme.js`, `media.js`)
- Use consistent naming patterns across the project

## Module Organization

### Imports and Exports
- Use ES6 `import`/`export` syntax exclusively
- Use named exports for multiple exports from a module
- Use default exports for single-purpose modules
- Group imports: external CDN modules first, then internal modules
- Use relative paths for local modules: `./deck/theme.js`
- Use absolute CDN paths for external modules: `https://unpkg.com/...`

### Dependencies
- Minimize external dependencies
- Use CDN links for external dependencies
- Prefer ESM-compatible versions when available
- Use specific versions to ensure stability
- Document all external dependencies and their CDN sources

## Component Architecture

### Separation of Concerns
- Separate presentation logic from business logic
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Use composition over inheritance
- Extract reusable logic into utility functions

### Data Flow
- Use props for parent-to-child communication
- Use callbacks for child-to-parent communication
- Keep state as close to where it's used as possible
- Use context for deeply nested data sharing

## Documentation

### Code Documentation
- Document complex algorithms and business logic
- Include usage examples for utility functions
- Keep README files up to date
- Document API changes and breaking changes

### Project Documentation
- Maintain clear project structure documentation
- Document setup and development processes
- Include troubleshooting guides
- Keep architecture decisions documented
